# dash-dashboard-and-web-maps-app-temp

This prototype of oil and gas dashboard mainly uses Python and Dash. I understand this code still has so many bugs and needs an improvement, so it will be updated regularly.
The step-by-step of compiling this code:
1. run code "pip install -r requirements.txt" on your virtual environment
2. run python file on "main.py"
3. open the website running by Dash on http://127.0.0.1:8000/


this is the screenshots of the dashboard
